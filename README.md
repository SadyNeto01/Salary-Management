# Salary Management 
 First project made for University
 
The "SalaryManagement" Java program is a simple console-based employee management system. It allows users to interact with a list of employees, providing features such as inserting new employees, listing existing employees, updating their salaries, deleting employees, sorting by name, loading data from a file, and saving data to a file. The program employs a menu-driven interface using JOptionPane for user interaction. It demonstrates fundamental concepts such as arrays, file handling, and basic data manipulation
